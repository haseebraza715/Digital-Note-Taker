Spacing and Layout:

Increase spacing between individual note cards for a less cluttered appearance.
Add padding within each note card, especially around the text, for better readability.
Center-align the “Add Note” form or place it in a sidebar if you prefer a more modern layout.
Typography Enhancements:

Use distinct font sizes for the title, content, and tags. For example, make the title bold and slightly larger than the content to create a visual hierarchy.
Experiment with a different font for the titles to make them stand out more.
Improved Buttons:

Use icons alongside the “Edit” and “Delete” text, like a pencil for edit and a trash can for delete. This provides a quick visual cue for users.
Style the “Add Note” button to be more prominent, as it's a primary action. You could add a shadow effect or a hover animation to make it stand out.
Tagging Visualization:

Consider making each tag a small colored label or badge within each note, as this would visually separate tags from the note content and improve readability.
Responsive Design:

Test the app on different screen sizes. You might want to use a single-column layout for smaller screens and adjust the grid on larger screens.
Functional and Code Fixes
Form Reset After Update:

Make sure that after updating a note, the form clears. Currently, it seems that the form fields stay populated with the previous note’s data after updating. Check that setSelectedNote(null) is correctly called to reset the form.
Prevent Duplicate Notes:

Add validation to prevent adding duplicate notes, especially if users accidentally click “Add Note” multiple times. You could disable the button until the API response returns.
Error Messages:

Display error messages if a note fails to save, update, or delete. For instance, if there's a network error or if the backend is down, users should receive feedback instead of silent failures.
Input Validations:

Ensure each field has validation. For example, titles should not be empty, and tags should follow a certain format if required (e.g., no spaces).
Auto-save Feature:

Consider implementing an auto-save feature that periodically saves note changes in local storage. This helps users avoid losing data if they accidentally leave the page.
Character Limits:

Enforce character limits for title and content to prevent excessively long text from breaking the layout. Inform users of these limits by showing a character counter.
